The goal of this project is to be an easy-to-configure block explorer for Ethereum-based networks.

Initially, the explorer will only work in read-only mode, without a database to store network actions. In other words, it will be used exclusively for transaction queries, block details, and address queries.

We will contribute to increasingly adding features to the explorer.
